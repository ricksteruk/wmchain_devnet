# WM CHAIN testnet exploration notes

Hi! Here are some basic details to get you started exploring the first WM Chain testnet settling to ETH Sepolia.  This information is mostly collected from ENO community testing that has been shared in Discord

## Create New Chrome Profile and install EVM Wallet

It's best to keep this test setup totally isolated from your main account and wallets - so create a new Profile for Chroms and download an EVM browser extension wallet.   [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) works well but is a little ugly and fiddly with settings in places, [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/)  is much easier on the eye but does not allow you to add custom tokens.  [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) seems to be a good compromise of functionality and nice UI.   You can create a wallet on one of these and then import the seed phrase into one of the others if you want to try it out.  Just delete or disable the wallet extensions you are not using once you've tested them out to avoid possible conflicts.

## Obtain ETH on Sepolia testnet

First we will need to obtain some ETH on the Sepolia testnet.

You can visit this Google faucet - you will need to sign in to your Google account and you can claim 0.05 ETH per 24 hours.

Or use this faucet - but you will need to have at least 0.01 ETH on your mainnet Ethereum account

You should probably obtain at least 0.06 ETH on the Sepolia testnet so you might need to make a few claims


## Obtain WMTx testnet tokens ( called PTT )

`NOTE: Some people have had errors using the WM Faucet - try creating a new blank Chrome profile or disabling any other extensions if you have problems - install the wallet browser extension and import your seed phrase.  Coinbase wallet extension might be more reliable than MetaMask`

Visit the WM faucet

connect your wallet and then claim your 1 PTT.   You can claim once per 24 hour period
